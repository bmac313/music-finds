# MusicFinds

====

Description:
* MusicFinds is a web app that lets users can share their finds at record stores (including vinyl, CDs, and others). It's intended to be used to share items you aren't buying, but think someone else might be interested in.
* To see how the app works, visit <a href="http://music-finds.herokuapp.com">http://music-finds.herokuapp.com</a>.

Important Notes:
* "Log Out" is currently visible while logged out (and vice versa) to avert a bug that was affecting several pages on the site. I am planning to update the
  login system to use Spring Security instead, so the app will remain this way for the time being. However, the login
  functionality still works.
